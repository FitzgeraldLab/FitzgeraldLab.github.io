Digital image correlation was used to compute the deformation of the wing under constant strain with greater accuracy.

This can be advantageous when it would be difficult or too time-consuming to alter or modify a system with sensors.  A key area where this is needed is the study of insect flight.  Using multiple, synchronized cameras to capture free flying insects permits natural untethered flight and behaviors to be captured, reconstructed, and analyzed.  The mechanics of the fluid-structure interactions of insect flight is a vibrant multidisciplinary topic.  Advancements in this field could lead to both better understanding the natural world as well as our ability to design mechanisms inspired by nature.  The ability to accurately reconstruct the motion of free flying insects presents a treasure trove of data.  Using this information as inputs to numerical fluid-structure simulations would permit modeling and load estimation.As a preliminary starting place, a pair of high speeds cameras are used to collect stereo images for a known-body undergoing some time-dependent deformation. A common difficulty in general reconstruction is having parts of body not visible in all the images.  These occlusions present many modeling difficulties.  However, if the body's geometry and material properties can be estimated then a geometrically-exact nonlinear finite element model can be constructed to model its behavior.  Using this dynamic model, inputs from the photogrammetry are used with an Extended Kalman Filter to aid in the estimation of the entire state of the body.Special thanks to the Haythornthwaite Foundation and the Applied Mechanics Division of the ASME.

The static configuration, mode shapes, and natural frequencies of the pre-stressed beam are obtained by using geometrically exact, Euler-Bernoulli beam theory. The beam is assumed to be not shear deformable and inextensible because of its slenderness and uniform, closed cross-section, as well as the boundary conditions under consideration. The static configuration and the modal information are validated with experimental data and compared to results obtained from nonlinear finite-element analysis software. In addition to the modal analysis about general static configurations, special consideration is given to an initially straight beam that is deformed into semi-circular and circular static configurations. For these special circular cases, the partial differential equation of motion is reduced to a sixth-order differential equation with constant coefficients, and solutions of this system are examined.

Here, a novel FSI strategy is introduced, through which a large scale fluids solver is combined with a solver for solids with high flexibility. The Navier-Stokes equations for incompressible flow are discretized by using standard central finite differences on a staggered mesh. The fluid domain is spatially decomposed through the use of the FLASH modeling framework. The solid body is discretized via geometrically exact Total Lagrangian finite elements. A novel hyperelastic material law that extends the engineering stress-strain law to finite deformations and arbitrary rotations is also implemented. The Lagrangian body is embedded in the Cartesian fluid grid by immersed boundary methods.

A flexible, two-dimensional, two-link model moving within a viscous fluid was considered. The Navier–Stokes equations governing the fluid dynamics were solved together with the equations governing the structural dynamics by using a strongly coupled fluid–structure interaction scheme. Harmonic kinematics was used to prescribe the motions of one of the links, thus effectively reducing the wing to a single degree-of-freedom oscillator. The wing's flexibility was characterized by the ratio of the flapping frequency to the natural frequency of the structure. Apart from the rigid case, different values of this frequency ratio (only in the range of 1/2 to 1/6) were considered at the Reynolds numbers of 75, 250 and 1000. It was found that flexibility can enhance aerodynamic performance and that the best performance is realized when the wing is excited by a non-linear resonance at 1/3 of the natural frequency. Specifically, at Reynolds numbers of 75, 250 and 1000, the aerodynamic performance that is characterized by the ratio of lift coefficient to drag coefficient is respectively increased by 28%, 23% and 21% when compared with the corresponding ratios of a rigid wing driven with the same kinematics. For all Reynolds numbers, the lift generated per unit driving power is also enhanced in a similar manner. The wake capture mechanism is enhanced, due to a stronger flow around the wing at stroke reversal, resulting from a stronger end of stroke vortex at the trailing edge. The present study provides some clues about how flexibility affects the aerodynamic performance in low Reynolds number flapping flight. In addition, it points to the importance of considering non-linear resonances for enhancing aerodynamic performance.","tags":null,"title":"Influence of flexibility on the aerodynamic performance of a hovering wing","type":"publication"},{"authors":["M.

Wing flexibility has received less attention and as of today it remains unclear if it can be exploited for better performance at low-Reynolds-number flapping flight. To bridge this gap we performed simulations of a two-dimensional, two-component wings connected by a hinge with a torsional spring. The motion of the lead body has prescribed kinematics, while the trailing body motion is passive. One of the primary outcomes of this work is that nonlinear resonances play an important role in the performance of a given flapping wing system, mainly by modifying the formation of leading and trailing edge vortices. For the flexible profile used, the mean values of lift and drag forces, and the ratio of lift to drag are enhanced when the system responds in the nonlinear resonance region.","tags":null,"title":"The effects of flexibility on the performance of flapping airfoils","type":"publication"}]
